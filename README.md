I’m a Senior Mobile Engineer focused on AI-driven development workflows and modern vibe-coding practices, building high-quality mobile applications with solid expertise in Dart, BLoC, and scalable architecture patterns.
My career started in Native Android Development (Java/Kotlin, MVP), which gives me strong fundamentals in mobile engineering and performance optimization.

I enjoy learning new backend concepts occasionally so I can build small APIs or understand full-stack workflows better — but my core focus remains mobile development.

I frequently publish POCs, utility code, and small open-source samples that help other developers explore ideas or solve practical problems.
